Problem Statement:

Light Kingdom is fighting a ruthless war against Conflict Empire. As a general of Light Kingdom, you decided to attack the
enemy with a linear formation of soldiers. You ordered that each soldier in the attack line should protect their two nearest
neighbors in the line. These two neighbors are called pals. Note that the leftmost soldier does not have a left pal and the
rightmost soldier does not have a right pal. If the either of the pals of a soldier is killed, then the next living neighbor to the
left/right becomes that soldierâ€™s new pal.
As the time passes, the battle becomes much more fierce and many soldiers are being killed by light sabers, blaster pistols
and magical spells. In order to keep soldier aware of their pals you need to update them about their new pals after receiving
each loss report.

Input
The first line of input contains two integers N and M ( 1 <= N <= M <= 100,000 ) representing the number of
soldiers in the attack line and the number of loss reports respectively. Soldiers are numbered from 1 to N according to
their positions in the attack line where 1 identifies the leftmost soldier and N identifies the rightmost soldier. Each of the
following M lines describes a loss report and contains two integers L (left) and R (right), meaning that soldiers from L
to R were killed ( 1 <= L <= R <= N ). It is guaranteed that those soldiers were alive until that moment.

Output
You should print M lines. In the i-th line should contain the new pal relationships formed after removing from the attack line
the soldiers who were killed according to the i-th loss report. That is, for the loss report L R , print the first living soldier to
the left of L and the first living soldier to the right of R . If there is no surviving soldier in some direction, print the character
* instead.

Example 1
Input:
1 1
1 1
Output:
* *

Example 2
Input:
10 4
2 5
6 9
1 1
10 10
Output:
1 6
1 10
* 10
* *

Example 3
Input:
5 1
1 1
Output:
* 2
